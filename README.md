## Insights

While developing the Movie Database Application, I gained valuable insights into implementing CRUD operations using Node.js and Express, along with MongoDB. This involved learning how to create, read, update, and delete data from a database, specifically MongoDB, within the context of a web application. This experience deepened my understanding of data persistence and management in modern web development.
